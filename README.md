### Project Overview <a name = "overview"></a>

In this project the goal is to analyse user log data from a music streaming service called Sparkify to be able to predict which users are likely to cancel their subscription. In order to do that log data is provided that logs user events.  

### Project Motivation <a name = "motivation"></a>

To predict churn from user data is a very common topic for many different companies today. The use of logging and intelligent data analysis can enable machine learning models to predict which users are most likely to stop using the service which is very valuable to be able to reduce the number by different measures.
